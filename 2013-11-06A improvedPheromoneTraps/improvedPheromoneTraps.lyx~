\begin_layout Abstract
A field trial was conducted to test increased attractiveness of standard
 CRB pheromone traps by addition of ultraviolet light emmitting diodes (UVLEDs)
 and use of reduced release rate lures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
UVLEDs increased the trap catch rate by almost 3X when used in conjunction
 with pheromone lures.
 Only 2 CRB were caught in traps equipped with a UVLED but without a pheromone
 lure, indicating that the light sources act synergistically with pheromone
 lures.
 Our use of inexpensive solar powered UVLEDs is novel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
There was no significant difference in trap catch rate between traps equipped
 with standard and reduced release rate lures, even though th release rate
 was reduced by an average of 90%.

Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Traps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Linear trap lines, each with six traps, were established at six locations
 on Guam.
 Trap lines were set perpendicular to prevailing winds and the distance
 between adjacent traps was 20 to 50 m.
 Standard CRB pheromone traps (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hallett1995"

\end_inset

) were suspended at 3 m above the ground from forked sticks.
 We tested six trap treatrments at each location:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traps were visited biweekly over a period of twelve weeks.
 During each trap visit pheromone lures were replaced and trapped CRB were
 counted and sexed.
 Treatments were assigned to traps using a randomization scheme which placed
 all treatments once at each trap site during the experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Pheromone Lures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used Oryctalure manufactured by Chemtica.
 These lures are bubble packs which use a plastic membrane to regulate the
 release rate of the CRB aggregation pheromone (ethyl 4-methyloctenate).
 In this experiment, we weighed lures before deployment and after pick up
 so that we could measure field release rates.
 Preliminary work showed that rain water entered Oryctalures making it impossibl
e to accurately measure release rates.
 To solve this problem, we heat-sealed each Oryctalure into a thin polyethylene
 bag, reducing the release rate by about 10%.
 We made reduced-release rate lures by placing 200 microlitres of liquid
 removed from an Oryctalure into a 2 ml Eppendorf centrifuge tube with a
 2 mm (5/64 inch) hole drilled in its top.
 The centrifuge tube was then placed in a pottle which acted as a rain and
 wind shield.

\begin_layout Subsection
Ultraviolet Light Emitting Diodes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We attached two types ultraviolet light emitting diode (UVLED) devices to
 the baffles on our traps.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Type 1: The original prototype, manufactured by collaborators at USDA-ARS-PBARC,
 used a battery pack of eight AA batteries to power 4 UVLEDs.
 We added a 1 k ohm resistor to reduce current from 5.8 to 1.0 ma.with no apparent
 reduction in brightness.
 Thus the increasing battery life by at least 5 times..
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Type 2: We converted solar powered lawn path lights by replacing the standard
 white LED with a single UVLED which had been sanded to make it diffuse
 and omnidirectional.

Release Rates

Mean release rates for the standard and reduced rate lures were 14.32 mg/day

Trap Catch
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Statistical analysis of data from this experiment is still preliminary and
 conclusions may change prior to publication.
 However, here is what analysis indicates to date:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Traps equipped with a pheromone lure and UVLED had a significantly higher
 trap rate than those without a UVLED: 0.091 versus 0.033 beetles per trap-day,
 respectively (p = 0.008; t-test).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Difference in trap rate between standard rate lures and reduced rate lures
 was insignificant: 0.074 versus 0.050 beetles per trap-day, respectively
 (p = 0.291; t-test).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All traps equipped with pheromone lures trapped approximately equal numbers
 of males and females: 68 versus 57 beetles, respectively (p = 0.371; binomial
 test for equal proportions).
